"Redispersible Powders Product Guide
Production of redispersible powder
In spray drying process, the emulsion is first sprayed into tiny droplet. When the liquid droplet is in contact with hot air, it will be converted into ball-shaped powder due to the evaporation of water. The powder consists of polymer particle that is embedded in the protective colloid.
The protective colloid keeps the polymer particle apart, thus preventing the particle from irreversibly fusing together during the spray drying process. The powder is then mixed with anti-caking agent to prevent caking during the storage of powder.
Good redispersibility
When we add redispersible powder into water, it can be reconstituted into the emulsion easily. Below is the comparison on the particle size distribution between original VAE emulsion and reconstituted emulsion."

DCC Redispersible Product Performance
DCC 可再分散性乳膠粉績效
DCC RDP consists of vinyl acetate/ethylene copolymer and it can be dispersed in water easily to 
form stable emulsion. RDP improves adhesion strength, flexural strength, open time, anti-sagging 
and workability."
"Self Leveling Compounds
Product Function
DA-1141 is highly suitable for modifying self-leveling  flooring compounds. It is thoroughly compatible with all commonly-used superplasticizers, such as casein, condensation products of melamine sulphonic acid and naphthaline sulphonic acid. 
Addition of this redispersible powder improves adhesion, abrasion resistance, flexural strength, 
water retention, workability and the flow properties of the compounds.
DA-1300 can improve the workability of self-leveling flooring compounds significantly, leading to excellent leveling effect. It is possible to use DA-1300 without additional superplasticizer. 
DA-1300 can enhance the adhesion strength, flexural strength, abrasion resistance, shrinkage 
reduction and cracking prevention of self-leveling flooring compound. Recommended dosage of DA-1300 is 2-5%."
"Exterior Insulation Finishing System
Product Function
Exterior insulation and finishing system (EIFS) prevents the loss of the energy from the interior of a building to its exterior, thus achieving energy-saving effect. The redispersible powder can be added in the adhesive layer, base coat & key coat layer, finishing coat:
• Adhesive – Use for bonding the insulation material to wall.
• Base coat & key coat – Apply onto the insulation product with reinforcement (e.g. fiber web) being embedded within it to improve the overall structural impact resistance.
• Finishing coat – Top coat to protect the system against weathering.
By using DCC VAE powder in EIFS, one can improve the adhesion strength of mortar that is applied between the wall and the insulation material. Besides, it improves the impact resistance, weathering resistance and cracking resistance of the EIFS."

Product Handling
Product Handling
Redispersible VAE powder is non-toxic under normal condition of use. However, like all fine particles, it calls for certain basic safe guards during handling, such as wearing safety goggles and protective gloves. It is recommended to maintain good air ventilation in the workplace to keep the dust concentration lower than 10 g/m3 or as per the specifications of local regulations. 
If the dust concentration exceeds the specification, a general purpose disposable dust mask or respirator should be used. Please refer to our website for more details: http://www.dcc.com.tw or email to service@dcc.com.tw
Storage
Redispersible VAE powder should be stored in cool and dry environment. It is recommended to use the product within 6 months. Use the powder as soon as possible in summer. Storing the powder at high temperature and under humid condition will increase the risk of caking. Once open the packaging bag, please use up the powder possible at once, if not, one shall seal the packaging bag properly to prevent the powder from absorbing the moisture in the air. For redispersible VAE powder that is packed in paper bag, do not stack them or subject them to compression (in long run) to prevent caking."
