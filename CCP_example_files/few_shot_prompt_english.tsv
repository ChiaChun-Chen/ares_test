Which VAEP products are suitable for improving the flow of mortars?	"Self Leveling Compounds
Product Function
DA-1141 is highly suitable for modifying self-leveling  flooring compounds. It is thoroughly compatible with all commonly-used superplasticizers, such as casein, condensation products of melamine sulphonic acid and naphthaline sulphonic acid. 
Addition of this redispersible powder improves adhesion, abrasion resistance, flexural strength, 
water retention, workability and the flow properties of the compounds.
DA-1300 can improve the workability of self-leveling flooring compounds significantly, leading to excellent leveling effect. It is possible to use DA-1300 without additional superplasticizer. 
DA-1300 can enhance the adhesion strength, flexural strength, abrasion resistance, shrinkage 
reduction and cracking prevention of self-leveling flooring compound. Recommended dosage of DA-1300 is 2-5%."	Dalian Chemical DA-1141 is ideal for improving the fluidity of mortars.

What inorganic binders are recommended for mixing VAEP product powders with Dalian Chemical VAEP products?	"Redispersible Powders Product Guide
Production of redispersible powder
In spray drying process, the emulsion is first sprayed into tiny droplet. When the liquid droplet is in contact with hot air, it will be converted into ball-shaped powder due to the evaporation of water. The powder consists of polymer particle that is embedded in the protective colloid.
The protective colloid keeps the polymer particle apart, thus preventing the particle from irreversibly fusing together during the spray drying process. The powder is then mixed with anti-caking agent to prevent caking during the storage of powder.
Good redispersibility
When we add redispersible powder into water, it can be reconstituted into the emulsion easily. Below is the comparison on the particle size distribution between original VAE emulsion and reconstituted emulsion.

Product Characteristics / Advantages
Typical applications of the redispersible powders
• Tile Adhesive
• Grout Application
• Skim Coat
• Rendering
• Self Leveling Compounds
• Exterior Insulation & Finishing System
• Repair Mortar
• Gypsum Based Compounds
Advantages of adding redispersible powder in dry mix products
• Improve trowel ability and open time
• Enhance adhesive strength
• Increase anti-sagging performance
• Hydrophobic performance
• Increase impact resistance
• Increase abrasion resistance
• Increase  flexibility"	DCC VAEP powders are recommended to be mixed with inorganic binders such as cement and hydrated lime.	DCC VAEP powders are recommended to be mixed with inorganic binders such as alumina and silicate.	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]
